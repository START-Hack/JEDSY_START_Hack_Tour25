# <p align="center">  AI Object Recognition: Ground station for detecting flying objects </p>

## <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>
Jedsy is a Swiss/Liechtenstein Startup building long-range medical delivery drones that can dock directly at windows or balconies, eliminating the need for landing pads. Their technology is already used for fast transport of lab samples and medicines in Europe, Africa and Brazil.

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
__What is the current problem?__

Currently, paragliders, skydivers, or aircraft without transponders or with
transponders switched off cannot be reliably detected. However, for
autonomously flying drones, it is imperative to be able to detect them with
100% reliability and make appropriate adjustments to the route.

__What is the expected final product?__

A device, such as a cell phone, with a good high-resolution camera that
constantly monitors the sky and independently detects whether an object is
currently flying there. It must also be able to recognize whether it is a bird or a
human-controlled flying object. Furthermore, a flight route, approximate
speed, and a possible comparison with Flightradar and any objects listed
there should be checked. AI recording should also take place on the cell
phone, and the images or video clips should only be transmitted via the 4/5G
network when a command (drone flying overhead) is sent.

__Who are the users of this solution?__

The users are drone operators such as Jedsy, who want to control
autonomous flying drones and achieve maximum safety by reducing the air
risk to zero. Another use case would be airfields and small airports. There, it
must be documented which aircraft have landed and taken off in order to
charge landing fees based on duration, if necessary.

## <p align="center"> Data </p>

For us, the project is a blank slate. We only specify that it should be an Android app.
If time allows, a test should prove that the app works by testing it live for x minutes,
for example.

## <p align="center"> Technology </p>

We provide Android phones for testing and access to Flight Radar.

## <p align="center"> Use Case </p>

__Use Case:__

We are open to further ideas such as parking space tracking, forest fire monitoring,
automatic garage door openers, or other useful and monetizable business cases. We
could also imagine hiring an intrapreneurship team from the hackathon to
independently develop the product to market readiness and even receive a share of
the sales revenue.

## <p align="center"> Presentation & Deliverables </p>
__Presentation Prototype:__

_Format:_
- PowerPoint or Canva
- Android App

_Key elements:_
- It should be a presentation that focuses on technical feasibility, demonstrates the
high detection rate of flying objects, and highlights AI-supported technology that is
easy and practical to use.

- The presentation will then be shown to other drone operators, companies, and also
airfields and airports. The focus will be more on accurate detection than on the
technical device itself. The presentation will also be shown to FOCA and other
aviation authorities.

_Requirements:_
- The code should be well documented so that we can continue working
independently.
